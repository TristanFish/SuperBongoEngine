This is a repository for a 3D OpenGL game editor/engine that was created for a game programming capstone project at Humber College, developed by [Tremaine Duquesnay-Mellis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tremaine-duquesnay-mellis/), 
[Conor Long](https://www.linkedin.com/in/conor-long-456881112/), [Tristan Fish](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tristan-fish-427b5619b/) and [Declan Mcguinness](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mcguinness-declan/)

The game engine was created in OpenGL entirely out of C/C++, we started development in September 2020 and initially showcased it as our midstone project. 



# SuperBongoEngine Features
Our engine features an optimized deferred renderer that supports spot, direction, and point lights that dynamically update at runtime, a custom audio system, AI pathfinding and decision making algorithms, 
reflection-based object instantiation, dynamic scene saving, and loading, Entity Component System(ECS), GJK collision detection and response, networked collaborative editor, input manager, GLSL based materials & shaders. 


# Using The Editor

Our Editor was created from the ground up to resemble the most commonly used game engines such as Unity & Unreal. Below are links to how each user interface panel can be used proficiently.
